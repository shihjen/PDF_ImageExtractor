## PDF Image Extractor

### Background

In various professional fields, extracting images from PDF documents is a common task. Researchers need to include graphs and figures in their papers and presentations, educators want to enhance their teaching materials, and business professionals often need to use charts and infographics from reports. Manually extracting images involves locating each image within the document, copying it, and saving it individually. While this process is manageable for a few images, it quickly becomes cumbersome and error-prone when dealing with multiple images.

Our Automated PDF Image Extractor revolutionizes the way users manage visual content within PDF documents. Simply drag and drop your PDF files to initiate the extraction. The application automatically extracts and saves all images, streamlining your workflow and significantly boosting productivity.
